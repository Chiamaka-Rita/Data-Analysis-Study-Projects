## About
This study project focuses on the analysis of the maven marketing campaign results using excel as the analytic tool. 

### Introduction
Data driven decision is very paramount to the growth of any organization. Hence, every data at our disposal has to be critically analyzed to gather insights and profer solutions that answers business questions. A very critical key question would be...is the available data properly utilized to solve existing problems? and does the insights derived help boost a company’s revenue and marketing strategies?

### About the data
The data presented in this analysis is the Maven marketing campaign results. This data set comprises of 2240 rows and 28 columns. The data covers the details of their customers in relation to their personal profiles, product preferences, campaign success/ failures, and the company’s sales channel performances. More details about the data [here](https://mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-marketing-challenge).

### Problem Statement
The objective of the analysis is to understand how customers interact with the business, review the performance of marketing strategies, and how these can be improved. Hence, after having studied the data, I came up with the following business problem;
a)	Which customers generated the largest revenue
b)	Which products are performing best
c)	Which channels are underperforming
d)	What does the new customer acquisition trend look like
e)	What is the performance of the campaigns over the years

### Data Transformation, analyzing and Visualization
In this project, Excel was utilized for the validation, cleaning, analyzes and visualization of the dataset. 

 **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
  - **Wrong Data Type**: All columns except Education and Country were having the wrong data type. These other columns which included ID, YearIncome, Kidhome, Teehome, Dt_Customer, Recency, MntWine, MntFruits, MntMeatProducts, MntFishProducts, MntSweetproducts, MntGoldProdsSome etc were corrected to reflect the correct data type.
  - **Renaming Data Attributes**: The column Education has attributes graduation, and 2nd cycle. These attributes were renamed to Graduates and Second Cycle for better description of educational level.
  - **Age of Customers**: A new column was created to hold the age of customers. This new column was gotten by subtracting customers year of birth from the current year as at when this analysis was performed (2023).
  - **Blank Spaces**: There were 24 blank rows within the Income column. To avoid bias during analysis, the blank rows were handled. Firstly, the blank rows were removed from the dataset and average income of customers based on their location, education and age were calculated. These calculated averages were then used to fill up the blank spaces based on customers profile that matched the criteria for each calculated average. For example, if a blank space has the profile of a customer who resides in Spain, has a PhD and is 56 years old, then the income of this customer will be filled with the income average of customers with similar profile.
  - **Merged Columns**: Based on the legal classification of marital status, customers with marital status classified as absurd, alone and YOLO were merged together and categorized as Single. Also, the Kidhome and Teenhome column was merged into a single column and named Minorhome. This was done to add more context to the analysis because regardless of the child age since they are less than 18 years old, they are all regarded as dependent and gets the basic needs from their parents or guardians.
  - **Duplicates**: Finally, the data was checked for duplicates and none was found.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
  - **Location**: The location of customers greatly impacted the revenue generated by the company. Most of the company’s customers are located in Spain. There seems to exist a correlation between the number of customers in each location to the amount of money they generated as revenue from this location. Spain, Canada, and Saudi Arabia makes up for the largest number of customer base and also from the visual below these locations also generates the largest amount of revenue when compared to other regions.

  - **Education**: Majority of the customers base are made up of educated individuals. From the bar chart below, graduates show to have a higher spending ability followed by customers with PhD and masters.

  - **Family Size**: the number of kids in a home influence the amount spent in shopping. It is common to say that the more the number of people in a home the more money would be spent shopping. However, the reverse was observed in the analysis where the more the kids in a home the less the money spent shopping.

  - **Purchasing Preference**: The most preferred commodity purchased among customers is the wine products seconded by meat products. Also, these customers prefer to shop in store compared to other purchasing channels.

  - **Campaign**: There is an observed downward trend in new customer acquisition between 2013 and 2014. Although the last campaign shows an improvement in acceptance there is still a large percentage of rejection across all customer base. Hence, considering both the downward trend of new customers acquisition and below 50% campaign acceptance, the organization is in dare need of a better campaign strategy.
